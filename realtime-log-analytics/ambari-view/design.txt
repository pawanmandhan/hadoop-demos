This is how you put your object in the configuration map on topology submission:

Config conf = new Config();
MyObject myPreciousObject = new MyObject("precious");
conf.put("my.object",myPreciousObject);

StormSubmitter.submitTopology(args[0], conf, builder.createTopology());
This is how you retrieve it in the prepare() method of a bolt or spout:

prepare(Map stormConf,TopologyContext context) {

   MyObject myPreciousObject = (MyObject) stormConf.get("my.object");

}
